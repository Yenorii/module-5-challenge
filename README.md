The mean tumor volume is lowest for Capomulin (40.68 mm3) and Ramicane (40.22 mm3), while it is highest for Ketapril (55.24 mm3) and Naftisol (54.33 mm3). Capomulin has two potential outliers, with tumor volumes below 25.47 mm3, while Ramicane has one potential outlier with a tumor volume below 22.05 mm3. No outliers were detected for Infubinol or Ceftamin. There is also a strong positive correlation (0.84) between mouse weight and average tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin, suggesting that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes on this treatment.
